# Student Course API â€“ Backend (MERN Stack)
    A robust backend API built using the MERN Stack to manage users, courses, and student enrollments with full role-based access control and JWT authentication.

# Project Overview
    This project simulates a basic admission management system for educational institutions. It supports:

    Student, Instructor, and Admin roles

    JWT-based authentication

    Protected and role-restricted routes

    CRUD operations for courses

    Enrollments linking students and courses

    Instructor tracking for each course

# Assumptions
    A single student can enroll in multiple courses

    Only instructors/admins can create, update, or delete courses

    Admins can view and delete any user

    Instructor details are stored inside each course (instructor is a reference to a User with role instructor)

# How to Run the Project from Scratch
## 1. Extract the file and go to the main server
    extract the file as you already did 
    cd server
## 2. install dependecies
    npm install

## 3. Create a .env File
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/student-course-db
    JWT_SECRET=yourSuperSecretKey
## 4. Run the Server
    npm run dev

Make sure MongoDB is running locally or adjust MONGO_URI accordingly.
